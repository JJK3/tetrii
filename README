This project is to create different versions of Tetris in several
languages. 

Mainly, the intent for this project is to just be a nice way to
familiarize myself with different languages.  Each implementation
will be written within the paradigm of that language.  Meaning that, a
program written in C, will be written with a C mentalit.  While a
program written in lisp will be written in a lisp mindset using lisp
ideas.
